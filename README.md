## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete user records.
- A user-friendly and responsive web interface.
- Proper input validation and error handling.
- Separation of frontend and backend code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- Git to clone the repository (optional).

## Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>



  

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

``` bash

cd backend


2. Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the database:

Initialize the SQLite database in the backend directory.
Create the users table to store user information.
javascript
Copy code
// backend/app.js (or index.js)
// Database setup code here
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3001.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Update API URL:

In your frontend code, update the API_URL variable to match the URL of your backend API (e.g., http://localhost:3001).

javascript
Copy code
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // Update this URL
Start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Access the frontend application in your web browser.
Use the provided user interface to perform CRUD operations on user records.
Ensure that both the backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously for the application to work correctly.
